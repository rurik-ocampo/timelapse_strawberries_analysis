# timelapse_strawberries_analysis

This repo contains an analysis of a publicly available video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_tNMJTvy7I&ab_channel=mortrek.

The video was converted to another video of the same resolution but with less frames.

Several analysis technique have been applied to the video including:

- Discrete fourier transform of each image.
- Discrete coside transform of each image.
- RGB spectrum analysis, which includes creating a frequency graph based on number of pixels for each pixel value between 0 and 256. Then applying a discrete fourier transform onto each graph.

This type of analysis is done to see if there is a way to use colour to detect the ripeness of strawberries.
